      A graph is called a bipartite graph if its set of vertices can be divided
      into two disjoint sets such that no two vertices within the same set are
      adjacent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Given a graph, your task is to determine whether it is a bipartite graph
      or not.

      The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an
      integer K, the number of test cases. Each test case starts with two
      integers V and E, which represent the number of vertices and edges in the
      graph, respectively. The vertices are numbered from 1 to V. The next E
      lines describe the edges, each containing two integers u and v (u â‰  v),
      which represent an edge between vertices u and v.

      For each test case, output "YES" if the graph is bipartite, and "NO" if it
      is not.
