      A newly discovered worm virus spreads through a network. When a computer
      is infected with the worm virus, all computers connected to it on the
      network also become infected.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, suppose there are 7 computers connected as shown in
      &lt;Figure 1&gt;. If computer 1 is infected with the worm virus, the virus
      spreads to computers 2 and 5, then further spreads to computers 3 and 6,
      infecting computers 2, 3, 5, and 6. However, computers 4 and 7 are not
      affected since they are not connected to computer 1 in the network.

      One day, computer 1 becomes infected with the worm virus. Given the number
      of computers and the network connections, write a program to calculate the
      number of computers that become infected through computer 1.

      The first line contains the number of computers, which is a positive
      integer not exceeding 100. Each computer is numbered sequentially from 1.
      The second line contains the number of directly connected computer pairs
      in the network. Each of the following lines specifies a pair of directly
      connected computers.
