      There is a map represented by an N×M matrix. In the map, 0 represents a
      cell that can be moved to, and 1 represents a wall that cannot be moved
      through. You need to move from the top-left corner (1, 1) to the
      bottom-right corner (N, M), and you want to take the shortest path. The
      shortest path is the path that passes through the fewest number of cells,
      including the starting and ending cells. It is also possible to stay on
      the same cell without moving. In this case, the number of visited cells
      should increase by one.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this problem, day and night alternate. Initially, it is day, and after
      each move, day and night alternate. Staying on the same cell also causes
      the time of day to change.
    </p>
    <p>
      If breaking walls during the movement results in a shorter path, you are
      allowed to break up to K walls and move through them. However, walls can
      only be broken during the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can move from one cell to another by going up, down, left, or right.
    </p>
    <p>Given the map, write a program to find the shortest path.</p>

      The first line contains three integers N (1 ≤ N ≤ 1,000), M (1 ≤ M ≤
      1,000), and K (1 ≤ K ≤ 10). The following N lines contain M numbers,
      representing the map. It is guaranteed that both (1, 1) and (N, M) are 0.
