      A rectangular board composed of square cells is covered with a thin layer
      of cheese (indicated by gray cells in the image below). The board’s edges
      have no cheese, and there may be holes within the cheese.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the cheese is exposed to air, any cell in contact with air melts
      after one hour. While there’s no air inside cheese holes initially, air
      will enter once the surrounding cheese melts. In the example below, only
      the ‘c’-marked cheese cells melt after one hour, as shown in the
      progression from <strong>Figure 1</strong> to <strong>Figure 2</strong>.

      After another hour, only the remaining ‘c’-marked cells in
      <strong>Figure 2</strong> melt, resulting in <strong>Figure 3</strong>.

      In this example, it takes three hours for all the cheese to melt. During
      the melting process, the cheese may break into separate pieces.
    </p>
    <p>
      Write a program to calculate the total time required for all cheese to
      melt and, one hour before it fully melts, the number of cheese cells that
      remain.

      The first line contains two positive integers representing the height and
      width of the board, with each up to 100. From the second line onward, each
      row contains the board's structure from top to bottom. Cells with no
      cheese are represented by 0, and cells with cheese are represented by 1,
      with a space between each number.

      The first line should display the total time taken for all the cheese to
      melt, and the second line should show the count of cheese cells remaining
      one hour before it fully melts.
