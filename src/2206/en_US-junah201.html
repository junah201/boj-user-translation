      There is a map represented by an N×M matrix. In the map, 0 represents a
      cell that can be moved to, and 1 represents a wall that cannot be moved
      through. You need to move from the top-left corner (1, 1) to the
      bottom-right corner (N, M), and you want to take the shortest path. The
      shortest path is the path that passes through the fewest number of cells,
      including the starting and ending cells.
    </p>
    <p>
      If breaking one wall results in a shorter path, you are allowed to break
      one wall and move through it.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can move from one cell to another by going up, down, left, or right.
    </p>
    <p>Given the map, write a program to find the shortest path.</p>

      The first line contains two integers N (1 ≤ N ≤ 1,000) and M (1 ≤ M ≤
      1,000). The following N lines contain M numbers, representing the map. It
      is guaranteed that both (1, 1) and (N, M) are 0.
