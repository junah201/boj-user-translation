      Chulsoo's tomato farm has a large storage facility where tomatoes are
      stored in a grid-shaped box, with each cell containing one tomato.

      Some tomatoes are already ripe, while others are unripe. After each day,
      unripe tomatoes adjacent to ripe tomatoes will ripen. The adjacent cells
      are in four directions: left, right, up, and down. Tomatoes do not ripen
      diagonally or on their own. Chulsoo wants to know the minimum number of
      days required for all tomatoes in storage to ripen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Given the box dimensions and the initial ripeness of each tomato, write a
      program to calculate the minimum number of days needed for all tomatoes to
      ripen. Some cells may not contain tomatoes.

      The first line contains two integers \( M \) and \( N \), representing the
      width and height of the box. Constraints are \( 2 \leq M, N \leq 1,000 \).
    </p>
    <p>
      From the second line onward, the state of each row in the box is given,
      with \( N \) lines in total. Each line contains \( M \) integers where 1
      indicates a ripe tomato, 0 an unripe tomato, and -1 an empty cell.
    </p>
    <p>At least one tomato is present in the input.</p>

      Output the minimum number of days required for all tomatoes to ripen. If
      all tomatoes are already ripe, output 0. If it is impossible for all
      tomatoes to ripen, output -1.
