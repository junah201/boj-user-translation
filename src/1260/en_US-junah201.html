      Write a program that outputs the results of traversing a graph using both
      Depth First Search (DFS) and Breadth First Search (BFS). If there are
      multiple vertices that can be visited, visit the vertex with the smallest
      number first. The traversal should end when no more vertices can be
      visited. The vertices are numbered from 1 to \( N \).

      The first line contains the number of vertices \( N \) (1 ≤ \( N \) ≤
      1,000), the number of edges \( M \) (1 ≤ \( M \) ≤ 10,000), and the
      starting vertex \( V \). Each of the next \( M \) lines contains two
      integers representing an undirected edge between two vertices. There may
      be multiple edges between any two vertices. All edges are bidirectional.

      Print the result of the DFS traversal on the first line and the result of
      the BFS traversal on the second line. Vertices should be printed in the
      order they are visited starting from \( V \).
