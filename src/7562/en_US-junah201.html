      A knight is placed on a chessboard. The possible moves for the knight are
      shown in the image below. Given a target position, determine the minimum
      number of moves the knight must make to reach this position.

    <p>The first line contains the number of test cases.</p>
    <p>
      Each test case consists of three lines. The first line contains the length
      of one side of the chessboard, \( l \) (where \( 4 \leq l \leq 300 \)).
      The chessboard is of size \( l \times l \), and each cell on the board can
      be represented by a pair of integers in the range \( \{0, ..., l-1\}
      \times \{0, ..., l-1\} \). The second and third lines contain the
      coordinates of the knight's current position and the target position,
      respectively.
