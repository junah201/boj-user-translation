      Today, Seojun is once again serving as a teaching assistant for the
      Breadth First Search (BFS) class. Let's use a problem to check if the
      students have understood the content his father taught in class.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are given an undirected graph composed of \( N \) vertices and \( M \)
      edges. The vertices are numbered from 1 to \( N \), and the weight of
      every edge is 1. Starting from vertex \( R \), perform a breadth-first
      search and print the visitation order of each node.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pseudo-code for breadth-first search is provided below. Adjacent
      vertices are visited in <strong>ascending order</strong>.
    </p>
    <pre>

bfs(V, E, R) {  # V: set of vertices, E: set of edges, R: starting vertex

&nbsp;   for each v &isin; V - {R}

&nbsp;       visited[v] &lt;- NO;

&nbsp;   visited[R] &lt;- YES;  # Mark the starting vertex R as visited.

&nbsp;   enqueue(Q, R);  # Add the starting vertex R to the back of the queue.

&nbsp;   while (Q &ne; &empty;) {

        u &lt;- dequeue(Q);  # Remove the element at the front of the queue.

&nbsp;       for each v &isin; E(u)  # E(u): set of adjacent vertices of u (visit vertices in <strong>ascending order</strong>)

&nbsp;           if (visited[v] = NO) then {

                visited[v] &lt;- YES;  # Mark vertex v as visited.

&nbsp;               enqueue(Q, v);  # Add vertex v to the back of the queue.

&nbsp;           }

&nbsp;   }

      The first line contains the number of vertices \( N \) (5 ≤ \( N \) ≤
      100,000), the number of edges \( M \) (1 ≤ \( M \) ≤ 200,000), and the
      starting vertex \( R \) (1 ≤ \( R \) ≤ \( N \)).
    </p>
    <p>
      Each of the next \( M \) lines contains edge information
      <code><em>u</em> <em>v</em></code
      >, representing an undirected edge with weight 1 between vertices \( u \)
      and \( v \) (1 ≤ \( u \) < \( v \) ≤ \( N \), \( u \) ≠ \( v \)). All
      pairs of values (\( u \), \( v \)) are unique.

      Print a single integer on each of the \( N \) lines, representing the
      visit order of each vertex. The \( i \)-th line should display the visit
      order of vertex \( i \). The visit order of the starting vertex is 1. If a
      vertex is unreachable from the starting vertex, output 0.
