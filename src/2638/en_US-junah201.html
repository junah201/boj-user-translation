      A very thin layer of cheese is placed on an N×M grid as shown in
      <strong>Figure 1</strong>. Here, N represents the number of rows, and M
      represents the number of columns. The cheese must be kept frozen;
      otherwise, it melts when exposed to room temperature. Each cheese grid
      cell (a small square) will melt if at least two of its four sides are in
      contact with the air, and this happens exactly one hour after exposure.

      In <strong>Figure 2</strong>, the space inside the cheese is not in
      contact with the air, so the cheese cells within this space do not melt.
      Only the cheese cells marked with 'C' will melt. After one hour, if air
      reaches the inner space, cheese cells will melt as shown in
      <strong>Figure 3</strong>.

      The edges of the grid are assumed to have no cheese. Your task is to write
      a program that calculates the exact time it takes for all the cheese to
      melt.

      The first line contains two integers, N and M (5 ≤ N, M ≤ 100),
      representing the size of the grid. The following N lines describe the
      grid, with '1' representing a cell with cheese and '0' representing a cell
      without cheese. Each value is separated by a space.
