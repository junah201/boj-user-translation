      As shown in &lt;Figure 1&gt;, there is a square-shaped map. The number 1
      indicates a location with a house, and 0 indicates a location without a
      house. Chulsoo wants to define clusters of connected houses and assign
      each cluster a unique number. Here, "connected" means that a house is
      adjacent to another house either horizontally or vertically. Diagonal
      connections are not considered. &lt;Figure 2&gt; shows &lt;Figure 1&gt;
      with each cluster numbered. Write a program to input the map, count the
      number of clusters, and output the size of each cluster in ascending
      order.

      The first line contains the size of the map, \( N \) (a square grid where
      the width and height are equal, with \( 5 \leq N \leq 25 \)). The
      following \( N \) lines each contain \( N \) values (either 0 or 1).

      Print the total number of clusters on the first line. Then, for each
      cluster, print the number of houses in ascending order, with each value on
      a new line.
